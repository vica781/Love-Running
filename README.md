# LOVE RUNNING

This is the first walkthrough project from the Code Institute Full Stack Software Development course. The project is a static website for a fictional running club called Love Running. The website is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential members and visitors to the site.

This project was built using HTML and CSS, and is hosted on GitHub pages. It consists of three pages: Home, Gallery and Sign Up. 

First two pages were coded along with the course instructor, while the third page was created by myself as a part of the mandatory end-of-chapter task.
